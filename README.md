## Basics

- Downloads: set your folder in Settings or the Download Panel ("Browse…" uses the native Windows folder picker). If you specify a relative path, it resolves under your OS Downloads directory. Filenames are made collision‑safe.
- Auth: e621 username + API key. Stored locally in browser/Electron localStorage only.
- DevTools: enabled in development, disabled in production.
- Rate limits: paced around e621’s ~1 req/sec guideline.
