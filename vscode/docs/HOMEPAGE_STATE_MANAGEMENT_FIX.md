# Homepage Tag Section State Management Fix

## Problem
When adding a tag section to the homepage through the Homepage Settings panel, the new section would not appear until the page was refreshed. This was caused by state management issues where multiple components were using independent instances of the `useHomeSettings` hook.

## Root Cause
The `useHomeSettings` hook was implemented as a standalone hook that each component would use independently. When you added a tag in `HomepageSettings.tsx`, it would update its local state, but the `page.tsx` component had its own separate instance of the hook with its own state. They weren't sharing state, so changes in one component weren't visible in the other until a page refresh forced both to reload from localStorage.

## Solution
Converted the state management to a **Context Provider pattern** to ensure all components share the same state:

### Changes Made

1. **Created `HomeSettingsProvider.tsx`** (`src/context/HomeSettingsProvider.tsx`)
   - Moved all state management logic from the hook into a Context Provider
   - Provides centralized state that all components can access
   - Single source of truth for homepage settings

2. **Updated `layout.tsx`** 
   - Wrapped the entire app with `<HomeSettingsProvider>`
   - Ensures all pages and components have access to shared state
   - Provider hierarchy: ApiProvider → SearchProvider → HomeSettingsProvider → DownloadManagerProvider

3. **Updated `useHomeSettings.ts`** hook
   - Now just re-exports from the Context Provider
   - Maintains backwards compatibility with existing code
   - No changes needed in components using the hook

4. **No changes required in components**
   - `HomepageSettings.tsx` continues to use `useHomeSettings()` as before
   - `page.tsx` continues to use `useHomeSettings()` as before
   - Both now automatically share the same state via Context

## Benefits

### ✅ Immediate State Updates
- Adding a tag section now immediately appears on the homepage
- No page refresh required
- Smooth user experience

### ✅ Synchronized State
- All components see the same data at all times
- Removing, editing, or reordering sections updates everywhere instantly
- localStorage still provides persistence across sessions

### ✅ React Best Practices
- Uses React Context API for global state management
- Follows the single source of truth principle
- Clean separation of concerns (Provider handles state, components consume it)

### ✅ Backwards Compatible
- Existing code continues to work without modifications
- Same hook interface (`useHomeSettings()`)
- No breaking changes to component APIs

## Technical Details

### Context Provider Pattern
```tsx
// Provider wraps the app (in layout.tsx)
<HomeSettingsProvider>
  <App />
</HomeSettingsProvider>

// Components consume the shared state
const { settings, addTagSection } = useHomeSettings()
```

### State Flow
1. User adds tag in `HomepageSettings` component
2. Calls `addTagSection()` from the hook
3. Provider updates its centralized state
4. All components using `useHomeSettings()` automatically re-render with new state
5. Homepage immediately shows the new section

### localStorage Integration
- State still persists to localStorage on every change
- On app load, state is initialized from localStorage
- Provides persistence across browser sessions
- Works seamlessly with the Context pattern

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/context/HomeSettingsProvider.tsx` (new file)
- ✅ `src/app/layout.tsx` (added provider wrapper)
- ✅ `src/hooks/useHomeSettings.ts` (now re-exports from context)

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Add tag section → appears immediately without refresh
- [x] Remove tag section → disappears immediately
- [x] Edit tag section → changes appear immediately
- [x] Reload page → settings persist from localStorage
- [x] Multiple browser tabs → changes sync (requires refresh)
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] No console errors or warnings

## Future Enhancements
Could add cross-tab synchronization using the StorageEvent API to sync changes across open tabs in real-time:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleStorageChange = (e: StorageEvent) => {
    if (e.key === 'e621-home-settings' && e.newValue) {
      setSettings(JSON.parse(e.newValue))
    }
  }
  window.addEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange)
  return () => window.removeEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange)
}, [])
```
