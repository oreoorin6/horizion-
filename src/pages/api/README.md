# API Proxy for E621

This project is using the Next.js App Router, so the API routes are located in:

`src/app/api/proxy/route.ts`

If you're seeing 404 errors with `/api/proxy`, make sure you're using the App Router API endpoints.

The Pages Router API endpoints (in this directory) are no longer used.
